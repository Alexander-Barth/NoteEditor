A simple musical note editor and player in a web browser. 

A demo is available at:
https://alexander-barth.github.io/NoteEditor/

Wait that the web-page is loaded completely (it needs to download several sound files) and then hit play.

Your web-browser must support ogg files such as Firefox and Google Chrome.
